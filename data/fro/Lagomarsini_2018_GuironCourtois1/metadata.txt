note: "The tradition is split between, on one hand, cyclic manuscripts, that also include the Meliadus or manuscripts having a part of the cyclic raccord, but not the Méliadus itself, and, on the other hand, manuscripts with an incomplete text; also, there are two redactions, the first one common to most cyclic (complete) manuscripts, and the second one to the incomplete manuscripts (and a subgroup of cyclic mss). For this, there are two different stemmata, for both redactions. The tradition is very contaminated, but contaminations are not shown on the tree. δ1 is contaminated in some places by β*, and Mar probably by βy. The 361 probably by ε. Some even more contaminated manuscripts are not shown on the stemma."
